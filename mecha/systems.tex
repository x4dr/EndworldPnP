\section{Systems}\label{sec:systems}
A Mech needs a movement system, energy and heat systems and should probably have a seal, weapons and support systems.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Energy Systems}\label{subsec:energy-systems}
Energy Systems usually do not use a hardpoint.

\textbf{Power to Weight} is how much maximum output power per weight the system provides.

\textbf{Input} of an Energy System is generally considered its "fuel", but can also just be batteries or similar.
The Input is stored with other Cargo.

\textbf{Efficiency} is the function with input x being ratio of poweroutput vs maximum power output and result of
efficiency.
In parenthesis at the end is the efficiency at 100\%

\textbf{Output} is set during addition/modification of the system
(Engineering:Repair+ system specific skill, Competence vs 8, 4h).
By Default there are only 2 Modes: Power saving and Full Throttle.
Mode usage is marked for full hours spent in them, with the higher usage overriding the lower usage, except when the
remaining Energy is less than an hour, where minute/round calculations might be needed.
Energy E is in Rates of kilojoules/round, since Rounds are 5 seconds long, 1 Energy is equivalent to 5kw over 1 Round.
1 MJ is 1000 kj so 1 MJ = 200E\(\times\)r

\begin{tabular}{l|cccll}
    Type & E per t & heat/r per t & input & efficiency\\
    \hline Basetech \\
    Steampower & 0.7 & 8 & Coal & x/10 (10\%)\\
    FlyWheel & 20 & 0 & stored & loses 10\% per turn \\
    Crank & 2--100/human & 0 &Labor&-\\
    \hline Lowtech \\
    Combustion Motor& 140 & 2  & Combustible & \(0.5(x-0.37)^2+0.6\) (40\%) \\

    Solar Panel & 10 & 2 & Sunlight & Contamination dependent\\
    Batteries & 900MJ@10E & 2 & electricity & loses 10\% per month \\
    \hline Hightech \\
    Reactor & 300 & 5  & Fuelrods & 0.08 (8\%)\\
    CFReactor & 40 & 0.1  & Deuterium & 0.8 (80\%)\\
    Capacitor & 5MJ & 0.2/1E  & electricity & loses 10\% per hour
\end{tabular}


\textbf {Solar Panel} Deploying takes 5 turns times 100w or 5 minutes labor, any damage received while deployed
will also damage the Solar panel, production halved every 5 contamination levels, only works during day

\textbf {CFReactor} Cold Fusion requires start up energy, equaling the Output for 1 Round.

\textbf {Deuterium} 1 kg - 4.5 TJ or 900,000,000Er (effective at 80\%= 720MEr)

\textbf {Fuel Rod} 1 kg - 75 TJ or 15,000,000,000Er (effective at 8\%= 120MEr)

\textbf {Hydrogen} 70kg (1000L) = 10,082MJ or 2,016,400Er (effective at 90\% = 1,814,760Er)

\textbf {HFC-10} 10 liter - hydrogen fuel cell: Cylinder 20cm diameter,
35 cm height or 23cm cube=10L. \par
containing 9 MJ or 1800Er

\textbf {HFC-50} 50 liter - hydrogen fuel cell: Cylinder 40cm diameter,
40 cm height or 37cm cube = 50L,
\par containing 45 MJ or 9000Er\par
contains low power sub system used to power up basic systems (like hydrogen gas pumps for the PEM Stacks)

\textbf{CombustionFuel} 800kg (1000L) = 40,000MJ or 8,000,000Er (3,2MEr)

\subsection{Movement Systems}\label{subsec:movementsystems}

\textbf{Efficiency} is the ratio of power consumed to power used to move the mech

\textbf{Drag} is the general amount of power wasted the faster the mech is going

\textbf{Power to Weight} is how much maximum movement power the system can employ per weight

\begin{tabular}{l|cccccl}
    Type    & Efficiency & GroundCoefficient & Power to Weight & hardpoints &Extra\\
    \hline
    Basetech\\
    railbased            & 95\%& 0.8 & 500 & 1--50\%--4 & rails \\
    simple wheels        & 75\% & 15 & 750 & 25\% & flat terrain \\

    legs                 & 50\% & 15 & 100 & 25\% & all terrain\\
    jumpjets             & 10\% & 100 & 1000 & 1 & upwards\\

    \hline Hightech\\
    Spiderwalker         & 40\% & 2 & 400 & 50\% & any surface
\end{tabular}

Accelleration is assumed to be able to change to 50\%/80\%/100\% of max speed  in the first/second/third round\par
Pneumatic variants of the legs weigh half as much but are constrained to weightclasses light and below\par

\subsection{Heat Systems}\label{subsec:heat-systems}
Warning: ALL Dissipated heat contributes to IR signature
\textbf{Input} is the amount of power the Heat System requires to function actively
\textbf{Weight} direct weight of the system
\textbf{Cooling} how much heat is dissipated, passively/actively.
\textbf{Capacity} how much heat can be stored in this system.
Cumulative for the mech.

\begin{tabular}{r|lllll}
    Type & Input & Weight & Cooling & Capacity &Extra\\
    \hline Basetech\\
    Small Heatsink & 0 & 0.5t & 0.2 & 15 & Storage\\
    \hline Lowtech\\
    Radiator Vent & 10kw/t &scalable &(1/2) + (1/t / 5/t) & 0 & 1 Hardpoint\\
    Large Heatsink & 0 & 1t & 0.5 & 50 &Storage\\

    \hline Hightech\\
    Fractal heatsink & 0/100kw & 2t & 3/0 & 200 & Storage\\
    OVERDRIVE & 5MJ & 1t & 0 & & Gadget
\end{tabular}\par

\textbf{Coolant Dump}: When triggered, releases 100 stored heat together with 100L water, as a thermal barrier
\textbf{Radiator Wings}: Deploying takes 5 turns times 1kw or 5 minutes labor, any damage received while deployed
will also damage the Radiator Wings: radiates 10\% of total system heat, as long as 1kw  energy (for coolant pumping)
is applied.
\textbf{Overdrive}: When triggered, enter overdrive mode: able to act at double speed,
stored heat is spent insteadof gained.
When heat drops to 0 or below, Mech shuts down for 2d10 rounds and Overdrive requires a Competence, Gadgets-Repair;
10m;
Threshhold of 10 to repair.

\subsection{Sealsystems}\label{subsec:sealsystems}
\textbf{Level} how much the seal reduces Contamination behind it.
\textbf{Resistance} how much damage it takes to damage the Seal.

\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
    Tech & Seal Level & Resistance & Cost/Sector\\\hline
    Base &  6 & 2 & 1\\
    Low &   13& 3 & 2\\
    Mid &   21& 4 & 3\\

\end{tabular}\par

\subsection{Weapons}\label{subsec:weapons}
\textbf{Damage}
\textbf{Threshholds}
\textbf{Costs}
\textbf{Skills}

Melee weapons rely on the movement System, so their costs are in meters that are used to attack rather than move\par

\textbf{Notes}:
\begin{enumerate}[label = - ]
\item Melee Weapons: Ignore Shields
\item Manned Turret: X Depends on the mounted gun and the skill of the gunner
\item Light Artillery: Attacks take 1s per 300m distance, rounded up, minimum range 100m
\item 120mm Smoothbore: Can only fire every second round, requires Indirect for targets further away than 2k
\item Autocannon: may make another attack instantly for double the cost
\item Basic Pulse Laser: -0.1*contamination level dmg per km, rounded mathematically
\item Precision Cannon: Needs to be stationary to aim and fire, 1 turn of aiming between shots
\item Rocket Launcher: Ignores Shields
\item Rocket Platform: Ignores Shields, Beam rules
\item Railgun: Needs to be stationary to fire.
Loading takes 2 turns.
\item Advanced Pulse Laser: -0.1*contamination level dmg per km, rounded mathematically
\item Ramping Beam Laser: Every round, X increases by 1 while shooting, decreases by 1 down to 0 otherwise.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Defensesystems}\label{subsec:defensesystems}
Defensesystems are configured using the relevant \hyperref[subsubsec:defense]{Technical Skill},
the relevant usage Method, usually \hyperref[subsec:computer]{Computer Usage}
With (if not explicitly defined) the threshholds [5,8,13,16,19] or automatically by a Program of the corresponding level.
Configuration, Strength are the equivalent statistics of the Armor a Shield provides.
Configuration is required to start a Shield and takes 1 Action, but does not need to hit the lowest threshhold.
Coldboot can only be done after all Systems have been shut off for at least one turn.
Shields turn off when overwhelmed and have to meet the Reboot requirements (including another Configuration) to turn
back on.
Config X means that the specific Configuration Threshhold of X has to be reached.
Each Sector requires a Defensesystem on its own.
Defensesystems provide coverage for the Sector that they are in first, but if multiple levels (representing a larger
Generator) are present they can (during configuration) be spread to adjacent Sectors.
Deflectors and Dampeners provide their effects, if they do not cover all sectors, by rounding the portion of sectors
that are uncovered up to the nearest tenth and rolling a single die (Fate point adds Fate Bonusdice).
If the result is larger than the uncovered portion, the Field generator applies.
(1/8 missing requires 3+, 7/8 missing requires 10)

Strength like armor
Cost:  per sector of armor for Charging/Active states, per round\par
Failure: Normal behaviour on Failure is for the shield to turn off until rebooted.
Dampeners and Deflectors dont fail from damage.

    \item Composite: needs to be replaced, spare parts 200kg, success with 6+, scrap at 2
    \item Active: needs 10kW per round per incoming hit or Strength is 1.
    Repairs Success with 15+/Spare 5+, 1--4 Scraps the Layer, Freq1 subtracts
    \item Speedshell: Vent 1H per 5m/s;
    Repair 12+, 1--11 Scraps the Layer
    \item Ion: 20kW per Segment, on destruction energy Output is reduced by 10\% until scrapped armor is removed.
