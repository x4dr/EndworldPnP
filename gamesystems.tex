\subsection{Healing}\label{subsec:healing2}
For living entities damage is represented by wounds with the severity being the remainder of the damage after all
defenses were subtracted.
Humans roll a Fitness-Check once a wound starts healing.
For every met threshhold of the wound one level of regeneration rate for that particular wound is noted down.
Regeneration can be aided or slowed by circumstances, such as treatment or environmental conditions.
A resonance of frequency 1 also lowers the healing rate by that much, even going negative.
Wounds do not necessarily lead to death or permanent impairments, but if they remain untreated for a long time, or there
is a runaway effect on one of them, the Storyteller may decree either.
Regeneration accumulates over successive days, and once the current severity is reached, the wound is lowered by 1
severity and regeneration is reset to 0.
If regeneration rate is negative, and the regeneration rate falls below 0, regeneration progress is set to the wound
severity and then the severity is increased by 1.
Standard threshholds are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.

\subsection{Treatment}\label{subsec:treatment}
Treating of wounds is usually done with a Competence or Theory + Healing Check, where medicine and equipment can get modifiers or advantages.
Many wounds require medicine to be treated at all.
Treating them without will either not be possible or generate disadvantage.
Standard threshholds are 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, with results below 5 having negative consequences.

Treating Contamination Sickness requires at least 10g of Alacast, with the treatment of
Contamination Sickness inflicting the sum of all dice including and below a threshhold determined by the
Technology used (i.e.\ 5 for Saline-Alacast-Solution Injection).
The level of Contamination Sickness and internal Contamination is directly lowered by the number of hit threshholds.

In all cases Alacast is used to precipitate Contamination from the body, the
crudest way is to introduce Alacast to the bloodstream to precipitate it inside the body and hope the body expels
it on its own, more refined ways are basically a dialysis or a very specific targetting of crystallization seeds
and retrieval of precipitation clusters.

\subsection{Medicine}\label{subsec:medicine}
Medicine is used while making a Treatment Check.
Each Treatment of a wound using Medicine consumes
severity\(\cdot\)100g of the medicine and provides the specific bonus.

\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Naturopathy} uses healing and the respective field of the medicine.
    It provides a good floor and good threshhold bonuses.
    \item \textbf{Specialized Medicine}(name pending) live mixing of specialized cures from ingredients
    uses healing and the respective field of the ailment.
    It has no floor, but scales the best.
    \item \textbf{Broadband Medicine} is mass produced, refined medicine and uses a combination of
    Healing, Science(Medicine) and Red Biotech.
    It has a good floor, but barely any scaling.
    \item \textbf{Alacast} has no direct medicinal benefit, but effectively combats Contamination in all fields
    \item \textbf{Elixir of Life} is the top notch medicine, rejuvinates and heals nearly anything.
    Sadly, it contaminates the user.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Categories}\label{subsec:categories}
Every Character has a Contamination Resistance rating ranging from 1 to 5,
but in-world they are categorized from A to C\@.
\begin{enumerate}[label = - ]
\item \textbf{CatA} Humans are usually Supervivo and usually have Contamination Resistances from 1 or 2,
\item \textbf{CatB}s are outlaws or for some other reason living outside the Domes and Tribes. They can have any,
 but usually have Contamination Resistances of 2--4
\item \textbf{CatCs} are usually Tribals with Contaminatin Resistances of 4--5.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
    Entity & Contamination  Resistance \\
    Experimental & 1 \\
    High Tech & 2 \\
    Mid Tech & 3 \\
    Low Tech & 4  \\
    Base Tech & 5 \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Contamination}\label{subsec:contamination}
Contamination is a term used to describe the amalgamation of technology destroying nanoweapons, radiation, pollution
and general environmental hazards.
Contamination is airborne, waterborne, bloodborne and permeates pretty much everything in the environment.
It is usually assigned a level describing its intensity.
Only within the Domes
of the Supervivo, inside a Mech or in a similarily purified environment can the Contaminationlevel ever reach 0. \\
Levels below 0 are necessary for taking apart Experimental Tech Technology, but getting an area so pure is hard.\\
Levels 1--3
are rare areas of low Contamination, like Mines, Airlocks, outdoor markets, outdoor settlements and so on. \\
Levels 4--6
are the most common and usually inhabited by Cat-B\\
Levels 7--11
are usually inhabited by tribals but sometimes a few Cat-B have to make Camp here \\
Levels 12--15
are sparsely populated by Hardy Tribals, but usually deserted.\\
Levels 16 and Higher
are Oceans, Deserts, and other hostile areas.
Weird Things happen here, but some say there is great treasure\ldots\\
There is no upper limit for Contaminationlevels. \\*
If an entity is in an area with Contamination, every hour it receives the local Contamination
as Contaminationdamage.\par
\subsection{Contaminationdamage}
Anytime the an Entity receives Contamination damage, the character checks ther Contamination
Resistance plus all applicable modifiers (external only for external Contamination/internal for both) against the
level of damage.
If the Check fails, the entity takes one point of Contamination damage (causing a wound with
difficulty of the difference between check and Damage and raising Charactercontamination by 1, if applicable).
If the check fails with a difference of 10 or more, 10 are split off as additional damage. \par
Charactercontamination is applied as an internal bonus on the Contaminationresistance Check. \par
Every day before healing a Characters Contamination is applied as damage.
No Charactercontamination is caused,
but wounds are taken as normal.
If the result was a draw or worse, no selfhealing is possible that day.
Once per hour (about 5 minutes into it) a character directly interacts with an entity, the Charactercontamination*2
(+Intrinsic Contamination if handling directly) of that character is applied as Contamination damage,
resisted by a Contaminationresistance of the Entity.
While directly contacting an entity only the internal
resistance applies, direct contact might be piloting a mech, using a gun or shaking someones hand, but not being in
a sealed cargo hold, handling a sealed gun, breathing near someone who wears a face mask, or being processed
by a decon machine.
\subsection{Seals}
A seal of a level of X lowers the level of the Contamination behind it by X (they are usually from 6 upwards)
Contamination still penetrates weak seals.
Air has to be purified separately or enriched with oxygen.
(One human consumes about 500--600 litres of oxygen per day.) The Domes of the Supervivo for
example usually have a level 25 hermetical seal with purified and oxygenenriched air.\vspace{1.5cm}
Examples of human sized external contamination modifiers or in-place options\vspace{1.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
    1& An alacast infused rag or a shut wooden door (although oxygen may run out)\\
    2& a breathermask or a simple wooden door airlock (again, oxygen)\\
    3& a partial gasmask  or an airtight airlock\\
    4& a heavy partial gasmask with Goggles or a basetech air filtering facility\\
    5& a full gasmask\\
    6& as above + sealed clothing or lowtech air filtering facility\\
    7& as above + midtech scrubber (a little backpack)\\
    8& as above + hightech air scrubber or midtech air filtering facility\\
    9& as above + full mask with air from a compressed air tank\\
    10+& specially sealed suit with airtank or hightech filtering facility\\
