Modules are assigned to sectors.
Each sector has a size of 1, a module takes up some of that size.
Modules can be spread over multiple Sectors, as long as they are adjacent, although this will increase the likelyhood
of it sustaining damage.
Some Modules require a Hardpoint, there is generally only one Hardpoint per Sector.\par
A Mech has an effective Tech Level of the Tech at the 90\% point of the sizes modules ordered by Tech Level.\par
Contamination Damage applies to the highest Tech modules first.
Each Module can be damaged individually.\par
\section{Systems}\label{sec:systems}
A Mech needs a movement system, energy and heat systems and should probably have a seal, weapons and support systems.

\subsubsection{Energy Systems}\label{sec:energy-systems}
Energy Systems usually do not use a hardpoint.
\paragraph{Power to Weight} is how much maximum output power per weight the system provides.
\paragraph{Input} of an Energy System is generally considered its "fuel", but can also just be batteries or similar.
The Input is stored with other Cargo.
\paragraph{Output} are "Modes".
They each provide an energy budget for the mech, different Situations might warrant different modes,
generally there are 2:
low power mode where the range is maximized and
high power mode, where the output is maximized.
\paragraph{Efficiency} is the rate at which Input is consumed per mode.

\begin{tabular}{l|cccll}
    Type & w per kg & heat per w & modes & input & efficiency\\
    \hline Basetech \\
    Steampower & 3.5 & 5 & 100\%/25\% & Coal & 5\%/10\%\\
    FlyWheel & 100 & 0 & scalable & stored & loses 10\% per turn \\
    Crank & 10--500/human & 0 &scalable&Labor&-\\
    \hline Lowtech \\
    Combustion Motor& 700 & 0.5 & 10\%  & Combustible & 40\% \\
    \hline Midtech \\
    PEM & 500 & 0.1 & 0.05/0.02 & HFC & 90\% or HFC\\
    Solar Panel & 5000 & 1 & On/Off & Sunlight & Contamination dependent\\
    \hline Hightech \\
    Reactor & 1500 & 0.5 & 100\%--10\% & Fuelrods & 80\%\\
    Capacitor & 40kJ & 0.1 & in/out & electricity & loses 10\% per hour \\
\end{tabular}

\paragraph {HFC-10} 10 liter - hydrogen fuel cell: Cylinder 20cm diameter,
35 cm height or 23cm cube=10L, containing 9 MJ
\paragraph {HFC-50} 50 liter - hydrogen fuel cell: Cylinder 40cm diameter,
40 cm height or 37cm cube = 50L, containing 45 MJ
contains low power sub system
used to power up basic systems (like hydrogen gas pumps for the PEM Stacks)

\paragraph {Solar Panel} Deploying takes 5 turns times 100w or 5 minutes labor, any damage received while deployed
will also damage the Solar panel, production halved every 5 contamination levels, only works during day

\subsubsection{Movement Systems}\label{sec:movementsystems}
\paragraph{Efficiency} is the ratio of power consumed to power used to move the mech
\paragraph{Drag} is the general amount of power wasted the faster the mech is going
\paragraph{Power to Weight} is how much maximum movement power the system can employ per weight

\begin{tabular}{l|cccccl}
    Type    & Efficiency & Drag & Power to Weight & hardpoints &Extra\\
    \hline
    Basetech\\
    railbased            & 95\%& 0.8 & 500 & 1--50\%--4 & rails \\

\end{tabular}\par

Accelleration is noted down as 5 steps in 5 second intervals each (calculated from mech weight and power)

\subsubsection{Heat Systems}\label{sec:heat-systems}
Warning: ALL Dissipated heat contributes to IR signature
\paragraph{Input} is the amount of power the Heat System requires to function actively
\paragraph{Weight} direct weight of the system
\paragraph{Cooling} how much heat is dissipated, passively/actively.
\paragraph{Capacity} how much heat can be stored in this system.
Cumulative for the mech.

\begin{tabular}{r|lllll}
    Type & Input & Weight & Cooling & Capacity &Extra\\
    \hline Basetech\\
    Small Heatsink & 0 & 0.5t & 0.2 & 15 & Storage\\
    \hline Lowtech\\

    Fractal heatsink & 0/1kw & 2t & 3/0 & 200 & Storage\\
    OVERDRIVE & 5MJ & 1t & 0 & Gadget\\
\end{tabular}\par

\paragraph{Coolant Dump}: When triggered, releases 100 stored heat together with 100L water, as a thermal barrier
\paragraph{Radiator Wings}: Deploying takes 5 turns times 1kw or 5 minutes labor, any damage received while deployed
will also damage the Radiator Wings: radiates 10\% of total system heat, as long as 1kw  energy (for coolant pumping)
is applied.
\paragraph{Overdrive}: When triggered, enter overdrive mode: able to act at double speed,
stored heat is spent insteadof gained.
When heat drops to 0 or below, Mech shuts down for 2d10 rounds and Overdrive requires a Competence, Gadgets-Repair;
10m;
Threshhold of 10 to repair.

\subsubsection{Seals}\label{subsubsec:seals}
\paragraph{Level} how much the seal reduces Contamination behind it.
\paragraph{Resistance} how much damage it takes to damage the Seal.

\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r}
    Tech & Seal Level & Resistance & Cost/Sector\\\hline
    Base &  6 & 2 & 1\\
    Low &   13& 3 & 2\\
    Mid &   21& 4 & 3\\
    High &  30& 5 & 4\\

\end{tabular}\par

\subsubsection{Weapons}\label{sec:weapons}
\paragraph{Damage}
\paragraph{Threshholds}
\paragraph{Costs}

Melee weapons rely on the movement System, so their costs are in meters that are used to attack rather than move\par

Roll Black Biotech, every 15\% missing from the corpse or order of magnitude in days that has passed since the time of death
lowers the final score by 1.
If the roll succeeds, place 5 wounds of severity 15-result on that character, they lose
one level from the highest Ability and one from the highest Skill and are alive again.
If the roll does not succeed,
5\% of the total corpse and the dosage of EOL is lost.
