Threaten - giving target options, or damage
Achieve  - gain an advantage, position/whatever
Prevent - negate an opponents progress

Do not need to be differentiated explicitly

Goal is progressed with Attribute,skill+skill -> Roll (2-20)

weapon has an attack
target has armor

Everyone make a defensive roll, there is passive defense, that only needs to be done once until something happens
(cover, hiding) and can be complete (no line of sight, no interaction), full (minimal risk) or partial (cover just counts as its value)
Active defense that results from the action (running, dodging, rolling, jumping and so on) usually comes with 2 malus dice on other actions

Attacking is an action
Negative modifiers:
-range under min or above mid,
-cover
Positive modifiers:
+from ammo (armor pen and such)
+from (previous)aim/mods


attack := roll()
attack -= (range modifier - specific range bonuses)
is attack <0? cover missed
attack -= defense
is attack < 0? cover hit, possibly damaged
attack -= (armor-armorpen)
is <0? armor hit, scratched
is attack >0? hit, damage
attack >armor? DESTROY




Detection -> Tracking -> Lock

what do hits mean?
a reduction in protection
effort in restoration
potential death
