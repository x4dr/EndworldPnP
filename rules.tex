\section{The Selector System}\label{subsec:selectorsystem}
This System uses  ten sided dice.
A Check is a roll of usually 5 dice interpreted in a certain way,
with the result describing how successfull the attempted action was.\par
Whenever there is advantage or disadvantage of any kind,
\hyperref[subsec:bonus--and-penaltydice]{Bonus- or Penaltydice} may be applicable.
The Roll itself is interpreted by your \emph{Selectors} which usually are defined
by the applicable Attribute and Skill, but may be static, or Equipment based.
The Dice in the Roll are ordered and given an order-number in ascending order by value.
To get the Result of the Roll (or to \emph{interpret} the roll), every selector \emph{selects} a die with the
appropriate order-number and adds them to the result.
Selectors greater than the biggest order-number simply select the highest die.
A Selector of 0 selects no die.
The usual number of Selectors is 2.\par
The effects and result of the Check may then be further modified by \hyperref[subsec:resonance]{Resonance}.
\vspace{1cm}

\section{Bonus- and Penaltydice}\label{subsec:bonus--and-penaltydice}
Bonus and Penaltydice cancel each other out, so 3 Bonusdice and 2 Penaltydice results in 1 Bonusdie.\par
They describe how many extra dice are rolled on a given Roll.
If Bonusdice were rolled,
remove the lowest dice from the Roll until the number of dice is as it was before the extra dice.
For Penaltydice, the highest are removed instead.
Neither Bonus nor Penaltydice ever change the number of dice being interpreted, just the relative Chances.

\section{Resonance}\label{sec:resonance}
Resonance is when in a Roll, more than one die, show the same Number.\par
The Resonance \emph{amplitude} is the number of dice \emph{that exceed 1}, meaning it is lower by 1 than the
number of dice.\par
The Resonance \emph{frequency} is the number those dice show.
If no Effect states anything about a Resonance, they have no effect.

\chapter{Skills and Attributes}\label{ch:skillsandattributes}
Attributes represent in what aspects of the gameworld a character excels and in which he doesnt.\par
Depending on the Priorities picked during character creation it may be easier or harder to raise them, but every
Attribute can be Applied to a multitude of general Actions, see the examples in the table below.\par
The Priorities and Attributes in the following Table are a not all that exist
but they are the most common Attributes shared by all humans.\vspace{1cm}

\chapter{Trade}\label{ch:trade}
These entries in the table below are usually equivalent, local supply and demand may vary them greatly.
Rolling for price variance might be done if there is no in-world reason why certain things might be more or
less expensive.
If that is the case the prices vary by \(((-1)^{1d10}\cdot1d10\cdot5) \%\).
Additionally everyone a character trades with has self interest and will keep \(5\cdot(11-\)[Negotiation-Check]\()\%\) of
the tradevalue.\vspace{1.5cm}
Goods, at 100\% value each line is equivalent to one another and equivalent to 4 character creation points \par

\section{Health and Contamination}\label{subsec:healthAndContamination}
\subsection{Healing}
For Living entities Damage points are wounds with the severity being the remainder of the result of the damage roll
after all defenses were subtracted +1 for each other wound.\\
Humans roll a fitness Check per day and compare it against the severity of each wound, while self healing is
possible, success lowers the severity of the wound by one step, failure keeps the wounds where they are and
depending on the wound and environment, a score much (usually 5) lower than the severity infects the wound.\\
An Infected wound requires a success while selfhealing or treatment to remove the infection, Infecting an already
infected wound leads to another wound with half the severity (rounded up) of the original being created.
Infected
Wounds gain an additional level of  severity each day, starting the day they get infected without an upper limit.
Treated Wounds not only heal one Level better, they remove the treatment instead of getting infected.
Permanently
treated wounds, can not infect. \\
While a Human has equal to or more wounds than their Lifepool allows for, they are unconscious.
At Twice that amount
they die.
\subsection{Treatment}
Treating of Wounds with a Profession[Medical] Check, where medecine and equipment can get modifiers or Advantages.
Many Wounds require Medicine to be treated.
Treating them without will not be possible or generate disadvantage\vspace{1.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
    0-x & inflict a point of infected damage of severity 1+x and infect the treated wound\\
    1, 2, 3 & another wound of severity 1\\
    4, 5, 6 & nothing\\
    7, 8, 9 & treat the wound for a day\\
    10 & treat the wound until infection \\
    11 & treat the wound until infection and heal wound by 1 \\
    12 & treat the wound permanently and heal wound by 2 \\
    13 & treat the wound permanently and heal all wounds by 2\\
    13+x & treat all wounds, the treated wound permanently and heal all wounds by 2+x\\
\end{tabular}\vspace{1.5cm}
Treating Contamination is not as easy and requires 10g of Alacast.
Medicine provides no Advantages or Disadvantages
but equipment and circumstances do.
In all cases Alacast is used to precipitate Contamination from the body, the
crudest way is to introduce Alacast to the bloodstream to precipitate it inside the body and hope the body expels
it on its own, more refined ways are basically a dialysis or a very specific targetting of crystallization seeds
and retrieval of precipitation clusters via for example highly precise syringes.
It always lowers Contamination by 1.
Roll might be Medicine or Red Biotech, depending on circumstances.
\begin{tabular}{cl}
    0-x & inflict a point of infected damage of severity 5+x \\
    1, 2, 3 & inflict an infected wound of severity 4 \\
    4, 5, 6 & inflict a wound of severity 3\\
    7, 8, 9 & inflict a wound of severity 2\\
    10 & inflict a wound of severity 1\\
    11 & lower Contamination by extra 1 \\
    12 & lower Contamination by extra 2 \\
\end{tabular}\vspace{1.5cm}
\subsection{Medicine}
Medicine is used while making a Treatment Check.
Each Treatment of a wound using Medicine consumes
severity\(\cdot\)100g of the medicine and provides the specific bonus.
Improvised or unprocessed Herbal medicine
requires a check of the related skill first (Herbal/Red Biotech/Blue Biotech and so on) and only works if the check
has been successfull.
Herbal Medicine provides a bonus based on the degree of success of the first roll, but if the
roll fails the Treatment roll is made as if no medicine was present.
Improvised Medicine always gives the Advantage
of medicine being present but migt or might not help\\
Reliable Medicine processed in a modern way does not exhibit variation, though AGT Medicine requires a Red Biotech
Roll and uses the lower value and the Elixir of Life requires a Black Biotech Roll and contaminates user and patient
with 10-Result extra Levels of Contamination (even being able to lower Contamination).
There is no strong
requirement to make the rolls, not rolling however will result in a result of 0.
Alacast used as a Medicine does nothing for the Treatment but does provide +1 on the next daily contamination Check
per full Internal Contamination Level*10g used. (if contamination changes, new value counts).
\begin{tabular}{cl}
    Medicine & Bonus\\
    Herbal & X\\
    Improvised & 0/1\\
    Basic & 1\\
    Processed & 2\\
    Potent Medicine & 3\\
    AGT Medicine & 5 or X\\
    Elixir of Life & 10 or X\\
\end{tabular}\vspace{1.5cm}
\subsection{Categories}
Every Character has a Category ranging from A to C. So called CatA Humans are usually Supervivo, CatBs are outlaws or
for some reason living outside and CatCs are usually Tribals.
Every Entity that can be affected by Contamination from buildings over technology to living things have Category ratings.
The Contaminationresistances of Categories A, B and C are -1, 0 and 1 respectively.\par\vspace{1.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
    Entity & Contamination  & (internal) & Intrinsic\\
    & Resistance Level & Resistance Bonus & Contamination\\
    Cat A & 3 & -1 & 0\\
    Cat B & 4 & 0 & 2\\
    Cat C & 5 & 1 & 8\\
    Experimental Tech & 1 & -1 \\
    High Tech & 2 & 0 \\
    Mid Tech & 3 & 1\\
    Low Tech & 4 & 2 \\
    Base Tech & 5 & 3 \\
\end{tabular}\par\vspace{1.5cm}
\subsection{Contamination}
Contamination is a term used to describe the amalgamation of technology destroying nanoweapons, radiation, pollution
and general environmental hazard.
Contamination is airborne, waterborne, bloodborne and permeates pretty much
everything in the environment.
It is usually assigned a level describing its intensity.
Only within the Domes
of the Supervivo, inside a Mech or in a similarily purified environment the Contaminationlevel is 0. \\
Levels below 0 are necessary for taking apart Experimental Tech Technology, but getting an area so pure is hard.\\
Levels 1--3
are rare areas of low Contamination, like Mines, Airlocks, outdoor markets, outdoor settlements and so on. \\
Levels 4--6
are the most common and usually inhabited by Cat-B\\
Levels 7--11
are usually inhabited by tribals but sometimes a few Cat-B have to make Camp here \\
Levels 12--15
are sparsely populated by Hardy Tribals, but usually deserted.\\
Levels 16 and Higher
are Oceans, Deserts, and other hostile areas.
Weird Things happen here, but some say there is great treasure\ldots\\
There is no upper limit for Contaminationlevels. \\*
If an entity is in an area with Contamination, every hour it receives the local Contamination
as Contaminationdamage.\par
\subsection{Contaminationdamage}
Anytime the an Entity receives Contamination damage, the character checks ther Contamination
Resistance plus all applicable modifiers (external only for external Contamination/internal for both) against the
level of damage.
If the Check fails, the entity takes one point of Contamination damage (causing a wound with
difficulty of the difference between check and Damage and raising Charactercontamination by 1, if applicable).
If the check fails with a difference of 10 or more, 10 are split off as additional damage. \par
Charactercontamination is applied as an internal bonus on the Contaminationresistance Check. \par
Every day before healing a Characters Contamination is applied as damage.
No Charactercontamination is caused,
but wounds are taken as normal.
If the result was a draw or worse, no selfhealing is possible that day.
Once per hour (about 5 minutes into it) a character directly interacts with an entity, the Charactercontamination*2
(+Intrinsic Contamination if handling directly) of that character is applied as Contamination damage,
resisted by a Contaminationresistance of the Entity.
While directly contacting an entity only the internal
resistance applies, direct contact might be piloting a mech, using a gun or shaking someones hand, but not being in
a sealed cargo hold, handling a sealed gun, breathing near someone who wears a face mask, or being processed
by a decon machine.
\subsection{Seals}
A seal of a level of X lowers the level of the Contamination behind it by X (they are usually from 6 upwards)
Contamination still penetrates weak seals.
Air has to be purified separately or enriched with oxygen.
(One human consumes about 500--600 litres of oxygen per day.) The Domes of the Supervivo for
example usually have a level 25 hermetical seal with purified and oxygenenriched air.\vspace{1.5cm}
Examples of human sized external contamination modifiers or in-place options\vspace{1.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
    1& An alacast infused rag or a shut wooden door (although oxygen may run out)\\
    2& a breathermask or a simple wooden door airlock (again, oxygen)\\
    3& a partial gasmask  or an airtight airlock\\
    4& a heavy partial gasmask with Goggles or a basetech air filtering facility\\
    5& a full gasmask\\
    6& as above + sealed clothing or lowtech air filtering facility\\
    7& as above + midtech scrubber (a little backpack)\\
    8& as above + hightech air scrubber or midtech air filtering facility\\
    9& as above + full mask with air from a compressed air tank\\
    10+& specially sealed suit with airtank or hightech filtering facility\\

\subsection{Blueprints}
(rework on its way)
Blueprints are required for building(engineering) tasks.
To create a blueprint a character needs the appropriate materials
(usually a computer of some sort) the time required is based on the complexity of the project.
To find out if the
blueprint is within the capAttributes of the character check their specific Knowledge against the difficulty of the
project.
If the Character does not have the Appropriate Knowledge he can check sufficiently similar knowledge with
an appropriate disadvantage (1 per techlevel, 3 for different module classes on the same techlevel)
The modifier the blueprint provides is the result of the Check\(/2\)(rounded up)\(-3\).
Even a blueprint with a negative bonus is useful, since it enables the Attribute to build the item in question at all.\\
A blueprint states the name of the Item, its category and the required materials.\vspace{1.5cm}
\subsection{Engineering}

Building something requires a blueprint, the required materials, a workshop or something similar.
Check Engineering
modified by the blueprint bonus and the conditions (having nothing but a makeshift wrench in the desert might be -5, having state of the art
tools in an antigravpowered workshop might be +3).
The finished product is [check result \(\cdot\) 10\%] Efficient.
