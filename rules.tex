\section{The Selector System}\label{sec:selectorsystem}
This system uses ten sided dice.
A \emph{Check} is a roll of usually 5 dice interpreted in a certain way,
with the result describing how successfull the attempted action was.\par
Whenever there is advantage or disadvantage of any kind,
\hyperref[sec:bonus--and-penaltydice]{Bonus- or Penaltydice} may be applicable.
The roll itself is interpreted by your \emph{Selectors} which usually are defined
by the applicable attribute and skill, but may be static or equipment based.
The dice in the roll are ordered and given an order-number in ascending order by value.
To get the result of the roll (or to \emph{interpret} the roll), every selector \emph{selects} a die with the
appropriate order-number and adds them to the result.
Selectors greater than the biggest order-number simply selects the highest die.
A selector of 0 selects no die.
The usual number of selectors is 2.\par
The effects and result of the Check may then be further modified by \hyperref[sec:resonance]{Resonance}.

\section{Bonus- and Penaltydice}\label{sec:bonus--and-penaltydice}
Bonus- and Penaltydice cancel each other out.\par
The larger amount less the smaller amount describes how many extra dice are rolled on a given roll.
If Bonusdice were rolled,
remove the lowest dice from the Roll until the number of dice is as it was before the extra dice.
For Penaltydice, the highest are removed instead.
Neither Bonus nor Penaltydice ever change the number of dice being interpreted, just the relative Chances.

\section{Resonance}\label{sec:resonance}
Resonance is when in a Roll, more than one die shows the same Number.\par
The Resonance \emph{amplitude} is the number of dice \emph{that exceed 1}, meaning it is lower by 1 than the total
number of dice.\par
The Resonance \emph{frequency} is the number those dice show.
If no effect states anything about a Resonance, they have no effect.

\subsection{Blueprints}\label{subsec:blueprints}
Blueprints are required for Engineer(Build) tasks.
To create a blueprint a character needs the appropriate materials, usually a computer of some sort, but even sand and a
stick can work.
The time required is based on the complexity of the project.
To find out if the blueprint is within the capabilities of the character check their specific knowledge + Theory
against the difficulty of the project.
If at least one threshhold is hit, the blueprint is viable.
Starting quality of a blueprint can be negative.
Every threshhold hit increases the quality of the blueprint by 1.
If the character does not have the Appropriate Knowledge he can check sufficiently similar knowledge with
an appropriate penalty dice (1 per techlevel, 3 for different module classes on the same techlevel)
Even a blueprint with a negative bonus is useful, since it enables building the item in question at all.\\
A blueprint states the name of the Item, its category and the required materials.

\subsection{Building}\label{subsec:building}
Building something requires a blueprint, the raw materials and the necessary tools.
Check Engineering modified by the blueprint and the conditions.
The finished product is [check result \(\cdot\) 10\%] Efficient.
