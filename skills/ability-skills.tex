\section{Ability Skills}\label{sec:ability-skills}
\subsection{Biotech}\label{subsec:biotech}
Biotech is the Fusion of Biology and Technology \par
The ancient texts define Biotechnology as "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms,
or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use".
Biotechnology is such a diverse group of skills, that each field is ungrouped rules-wise.
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Red} Biotechnology Encompasses genetics, genomics, pharmacology, but also medical advances like
    genetherapy and automedics and deconamination of living things.
    \item \textbf{Green} Biotechnology is used every time the passive environment is exploited,
    from engineering high yield, low footprint farming to technologically harnessing the great and small Anomalies,
    including detoxification of materials and beings.
    \item \textbf{Blue} Biotechnology has developed from being used for aquatic Biotech, to include Megafauna, since the
    first Megafauna is told to having been spottet in the ocean.
    It allows scanning, categorization and assessment of Megafauna, including in some cases,
    harvesting Megafauna specialities.
    \item \textbf{White} or Industrial Biotechnology  is used in Industrial processes and in handling some of the
    results of such processes.
    Creating and applying contamination-sealant is one of such processes.
    \item \textbf{Black} deals with with integration of Biology and Technology from enhancements or replacements like
    Cyberware or more conventional Prosthetics to synthesizing life, ressurection and strong AI. Seldomly useful
    and the most dangerous brand of Biotechnology, it is not taught often.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Computer}\label{subsec:computer}
The Computer skill group describes the ability and training of the character to generally interact with computers.
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Programming} is creating or changing computer programs.
    \item \textbf{Usage} is using complex features of computers in intended ways.
    \item \textbf{Hacking} is making computers behave in unintended ways.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Engineering}\label{subsec:engineering}
The Engineering skill group describes the ability and training of the 
character to generally create and care for machines.
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Repair} 
    \item \textbf{Design} 
    \item \textbf{Build} 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Aux}\label{subsec:aux}
Auxiliary Training is training with specific types of equipment and tactics.
This includes operation and maintenance of these devices.
\subsubsection{Defense}
Skillgroup pertaining to defensive Equipment options.
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Decoys} From Flares against heat seeking missiles to Holographic Projectors, anything that guides
     an opponents Weapon to where it can inflict no harm.
    \item \textbf{Shields} Devices that dampen or stop kinetic energies, especially those of weapons
    \item \textbf{Deflectors} Anything that redirects energies, especially those of weapons
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Offense}
Skillgroup pertaining offensive Equipment and Tactics
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Explosives} Training with things like mines, piles of C4 and IEDs
    \item \textbf{Sniping} Equipment and Tactics to specifically target enemy Systems and increase accuracy
    over rate of firing
    \item \textbf{Gadgets} Hidden weapons, fireable homing beacons, Flare guns, Flamethrowers, Cryothrowers, Gas
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Recon}
Skillgroup pertaining to gathering information while remaining unseen
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Scanners} Equipment to obtain Information, from Sensors over Radar to Compositionscanners
    \item \textbf{Suppressors} Stealth equipment from mecha-weapon compatible flash or noise suppressors to thermal
    signature dissipating gadgets and even invisibility ``cloaks''
    \item \textbf{Sabotage} EMP, ECM, ECCM, but also poison, pitfalls and similar tactics
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Utility}
Skillgroup pertaining to opening up more options
\begin{enumerate}[label= -]
    \item \textbf{Communications} Equipment with the purpose of transferring Information
    \item \textbf{Reprocessing} Equipment to turn things into other, generally more useful things.
    From electrolysis to cooking.
    \item \textbf{Utility Movement} Equipment that allows movement in nonstandard ways, such as flying, climbing,
    swimming, boring or even teleporting
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Professions/Proficiencies}\label{subsec:professions}
each of these are a Skillgroup, meaning after the initial point, further progress needs to be specialized.
The exact nature of these specializations is open to player and storyteller.
