    [[someone has to still write flufftext... its gonna be meeeee]]


    Years have gone by since the Great War. Many Years. Even though few remember how long it has been, the remnants
    of a time long gone still remind us that once, long ago, the world has been a nicer place. But, the world we know
    now ... is not a nice place. Such a shame. I have lived a long life, and I have learned to adapt to the new World,
    but just as the Contamination eats away at technology and the lives of those who come into contact with it, time
    eats away at me. Such a shame, there is so little of it left for me. But the plans are in motion, Immortality might
    be in my grasp.\par
    I am ... well, it seems some Details are starting to slip my mind. I am Quaesitor, and yet again I am wrong, but
    not entirely. I was Quaesitor. I traveled from the great city of Terracina to the quaint outpost of Kodal to
    learn. A life time of learning of trying to protect what the Supervivo have protected so long. The ancient Knowledge
    and ancient Arts. Microelectronics. Quantum Physics. The like. We, the Survivors, the Triumphant, the Conquerors,
    forced to huddle in what were mere shelters for what would be a storm that has not blown over in centuries, it is such
    a shame. Marvels of modern Technology have kept me from dying these past 240 years since i retired, but no army of
    hightech mechs, no experimental biotech treatment seems to be able to extend my mind. I have forgotten so much.
    \par Such a shame.\par
    Of course we are not the only ones who survived. Beasts stalk the Lands, ferocious beasts, Megafauna, sly, intelligent
    and hungry creatures. In some cases literally. But even Humanoids, a pale imitation of real Humans, the descendants
    of vile mutants, vile mutants and savages themselves, such a shame to human kind. They raid caravans, keep to their
    barbaric cultures, forever cursed to Harbor the very Contamination killing their chances of ever knowing the pleasures
    of technology. And it seems that they have interfaced with and adapted to the Contamination, so it doesnt even kill
    them. Such a shame. \par
    Alacast can purify them just like anyone else, it changes the supernatural Contamination back to more normal
    Contamination, that is even mostly harmless to not just the Tribals but real Humans as well. Tribals can live without
    the Contamination, if ever someone would invest in cleaning a Savage up that much, they still can not contribute.
    I have tried. Some babble about cages and insults, barely comprehensible ramblings in their animalistic mockery of
    speech. They do not usually last long once they have gone through decon. Especially those infuriating Individuals
    who seem to have allied with the Contamination trying to kill us all, wielding its Zones Of Normalcy Exclusion like
    weapons. Such a shame. Wide ZONEs of heightened gravity or brittleness, Oxygen free ZONEs or pure Oxydation. Such a
    shame that they have to appear at all even if caused by natural sources. Savages funneling Contamination into a ZONE
    until even the best seal breaks down and the Pilots are eaten alive... Such a Shame.\newline

    \headline{Rules}
    \subhline{Rolling and Checks}

    This System uses 3 ten sided dice. A Check is a roll of one to three D10, interpreted
    in a certain way, with the result describing how successfull on a scale of 1-10 the attempted action was.
    1-4 are usually bad, 5 is usually neutral and above that are usually degrees of success.
    This may change depending on situation. \par
    The number of dice rolled and the way they are interpeted varies with Advantage.
    Circumstances that are favourable for the action may give Advantage, while circumstances
    that are unfavourable may subtract from that Advantage (give Disadvantage).
    Minor factors are usually expressed in a change of the required result of the check. Under certain circumstances (like
    good roleplay or similar) the Gamemaster may grant reroll, which allows the player to choose one die of the Check after
    it has been rolled and reroll it. The new result counts instead of the old one. \newline\newline
    How many dice are rolled for a Check and how they are interpreted can be found in the table:\par

    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|l}
        Advantage & Level & Dice & Interpretation \\
        -2& 1& 3& take lowest\\
        \hline
        -1& 2& 2& take lowest\\
        \hline

        +1& 4& 2& take highest\\
        \hline
        +2& 5& 3& take highest\\
    \end{tabular}\\

    \subhline{Skills and Abilities}
    [rework in progress]
    Abilities represent in what aspects of the gameworld a character excels and in which he doesnt.

    With the Exception of Knowledges and Professions every Ability starts at Level 1. \par
    Depending on the Priorities picked during character creation it may be easier or harder to raise them, but Every
    Ability can be Applied to a multitude of general Actions. For example Negotiation can be used while bartering or trying
    to convince someone not to harm a hostage. The Priorities and Abilities in the following Table are a not all that exist
    but they are the most common Abilities shared by all humans.\newline\newline

    \begin{tabular}{l||cccccc}

    \subhline{Trade}

    These entries in the table below are usually equivalent, local supply and demand may vary them greatly.
    Rolling for price variance might be done if there is no in-world reason why certain things might be more or
    less expensive. If that is the case the prices vary by \(((-1)^{1d10}\cdot1d10\cdot5) \%\).
    Additionally everyone a character trades with has self interest and will keep \(5\cdot(11-\)[Negotiation-Check]\()\%\) of
    the tradevalue.\newline \newline
    Goods, at 100\% value each line is equivalent to one another and equivalent to 1 character creation point \par

    \end{tabular}\par
    If a player has a good idea maybe that.\newline
    \newline
    Example:\par
    Character A wants to get rid of 5 tonnes of Base Tech Scrap in favor of more easily transportable Alacast in a local
    Dome.\par
    Since the Gamemaster is lazy there are no storyelements influencing the prices, so they are rolled. First, the value of
    the BTS is determined to be (Roll: 6, 4) \(((-1)^{6}\cdot4\cdot5) \% = +20\%\). Then the value of Alacast is determined
    to be (Roll: 10, 3)\(((-1)^{10}\cdot3\cdot5) \% = +15\%\). The result is that the rate between BTS and Alacast is
    \( 500\cdot1.15/100\cdot1.2 = 4.79\) \\ Which means character As scrap is worth
    \(5000 kg\cdot / 4.79 = 1043 g \) of Alacast. He barters (in which he has Proficiency) with a local merchant and manages to
    negotiate terms in which the merchant retains (Roll: 4, 9 \(\Rightarrow\) 9) \(5\cdot(11-9)\% = 10\%\) of the Traded
    value. He decides to trade and gets 938 grams of Alacast.\newline\newline

    \subhline{Combat}

    Life:\par
    Every entity has a pool of Hitpoints, which describes how far away that entity is from its failure point.
    In the case of a Mech, Mount or Human, that would mean being unable to fight or act in an effective manner. Living
    entities start dying when their Life reaches 0. How fast something dies is decided by the Gamemaster who may consult a
    Willpower-Check.\par
    If an entity gets damaged, the result of the damage roll (or the number set by the Gamemaster) is compared the results
    of rolls made by the outermost layer of defense. If the result of the damage is higher, it, depending on the
    layer of defense, passes through or overwhelms the layer. If damage passes all layers of defense, usually one Hitpoint
    is temporarily lost, representing the inflicted damage. \par
    Biological Entities also receive a wound with a difficulty rating of the remaining damage result.\newline\newline

    Rounds:\par
    Combat is done in rounds. Each round is usually about 3-5 seconds long. Every character present acts in turn (determined
    by circumstances or a Stealth, Perception, Willpower or other situational check) and can usually move and do an action
    (an attack or action that can be done in the remaining time).\newline\newline

    Combat against grunt groups/hordes:\par
    The mob rolls its performance depending on their Advantage/Disadvantage\par
    The fighting character decides (if he can, as appropriate by his gear/the situation) to fight offensively, defensively
    or passively and rolls the respective combat stat, then the differences between each of the rolled dice of the combat
    roll and the groups performance value is calculated.\par
    \begin{enumerate}[label= - ]

        \item  Offensive style: For each positive difference (character roll \(>\) group performance) the character makes as
        many group members unable to continue fighting as the difference is. The biggest negative difference (character roll
        \(<\) group roll) is doubled and applied to the character as damage.\\

        \item Defensive style: For each positive difference (character roll \(>\) group performance) the character makes one
        group member unable to continue fighting. The difference between the best die and the group performance if negative
        is applied to the character as damage.\\

        \item Passive style: Grants one reroll and one disadvantage for the attacker. Same as defensive, but no damage is
        inflicted.
    \end{enumerate}

    Detailed combat:\par
    The attacking character makes their to hit check (meele or ranged in most cases). The defending character Checks for the
    corresponding defense (agility/dexterity for example) If the attacker wins, they hit, on a draw the
    attack grazes. On a hit check for damage by (after calculating sizeclasses) rolling the damage level of the weapon.
    If all levels of Defense are breached, a point of damage is inflicted.
    \newline

    \subhline{Health and Taint}

    Healing:\\
    For Living entities Damage points are wounds with the difficulty being the remainder of the result of the damage roll
    after all defenses were subtracted +1 for each other wound.
    Humans roll an endurance Check per day and compare it against the difficulty of each wound, success lowers the
    difficulty of the wound by one step, failure keeps the wounds where they are and depending on the wound a score of 5
    lower than the difficulty inflames the wound.
    An Infected wound requires a success to remove the infection, Infecting an already Infected wound leads to another wound
    with half the difficulty (rounded up) of the original being created. Infected Wounds move up one difficulty each day,
    without an upper limit.
    Treated Wounds not only heal one Level better, they remove the treatment instead of getting infected. Permanently
    treated wounds, can not infect. \\
    While a Human has equal to or more wounds than their Lifepool allows for, they are unconscious. At Twice that amount
    they die.

    Treating of Wounds with a Profession[Medical] Check:\\\\
    \begin{tabular}{cl}
        -1, 0 & inflict a point of damage and infect the wound\\
        1, 2 & inflict one point of damage\\
        3, 4 & nothing\\
        5, 6 & treat the wound for a day\\
        7, 8 & treat the wound  \\
        9 & treat the wound and heal wound by 1 \\
        0 & treat the wound permanently and heal wound by 2 \\
        11 & treat the wound and heal all wounds by 2\\
        12 & treat all wounds and heal all wounds by 3\\

    \end{tabular}\\\\*


    Categories:\\
    Every Character has a Category ranging from A to C. So called CatA Humans are usually Supervivo, CatBs are outlaws or
    for some reason living outside and CatCs are Tribals.
    Every Entity that can be affected by Taint from buildings over technology to living things have Category ratings.
    The Taintresitances of Categories A, B and C are 0, +1 and +2 respectively.\\

    Taint: \\
    Taint is a term used to describe the amalgamation of technology destroying nanoweapons, radiation, pollution and general
    environmental hazard. Taint is airborne, waterborne, bloodborne and permeates pretty much everything in the
    environment. It is usually assigned a level describing its intensity. Only within the Domes of the Supervivo, inside a
    Mech or in a similarily purified environment the Taintlevel is 0. Levels 1-4 are rare areas of low Taint, like Mines,
    Airlocks, outdoor markets, outdoor settlements and so on. Levels 5-8 are the most common and usually uninhabited. Levels
    9 and higher are found in Oceans, Deserts, and somewhat secluded areas. There is no upper limit for Taintlevels. \\\\*
    If an entity is in an area with Taint, every hour Taintresistance is checked. If the Check fails, the entity takes
    one point of Taint damage (causing a wound if applicable). If the check fails with a difference of 10 or more,
    additional damage might be taken.\\

    Taintdamage: Anytime the a character receives Taint damage, the character increases in Charactertaint.
    Charactertaint is applied as an internal bonus on the Taintresistance Check. \\

    Taintcheck:  Taintresistance with no bonuses from external sources or Charactertaint, but +2 for CatB and +4 for CatC
    ist tested against Charactertaint. If it fails, one point of Taint damage is inflicted. If it fails with a
    difference of 10 or more, additional damage is inflicted. On a draw no damage is applied, but no healing of wounds takes
    place.\\
    Every day a Taintcheck occurs for every character with Charactertaint(unless the roll is irrelevant).
    Every started hour a character directly interacts with an entity, the Charactertaint of that character is
    applied as Taint damage, resisted by a Taintresistance Check.\\\\*
    A seal of a level of X lowers the level of the Taint behind it by X (they are usually from 6 upwards)
    Taint still penetrates weak seals. Air has to be purified separately or enriched with oxygen.
    (One human consumes about 500-600 litres of oxygen per day.) The Domes of the Supervivo for
    example have a level 25 hermetical seal with purified and oxygenenriched air.\\\\*
    Examples of external roll bonuses \\\\
    \begin{tabular}{cl}
        1& An alacast infused rag or a shut wooden door (although oxygen may run out)\\
        2& a breathermask or a simple wooden door airlock (again, oxygen)\\
        3& a full gasmask  or an airtight airlock\\
        4& a gasmask with enhanced scrubbing (a little backpack) or air a basic air filtering facility\\

    Blueprints:\\
    Blueprints are required for most engineering tasks. To create a blueprint a character needs the appropriate materials
    (usually a computer of some sort) the time required is based on the complexity of the project. To find out if the
    blueprint is within the capabilities of the character check Science against the difficulty of the project. The bonus
    the blueprint provides is [Science Check]\(/2\)(rounded up)\(-3\). Even a blueprint with a negative bonus is usefull,
    since it enables the ability to build the item in question at all.\\
    A blueprint states the name of the Item, its category, its bonus on a Taintresistance check and the required materials.\\\\

    Engineering:\\
    Building something requires a blueprint, the required materials, a workshop or something similar. Check Engineering
    modified by the blueprint bonus and the conditions (having nothing but a makeshift wrench in the desert might be -5, having state of the art
    tools in an antigravpowere workshop might be +3). The result times 10 is the efficiency percentage at which the build
    functions.(for example damage per round, lifepoints, poweroutput and so on)\\\\


    \headline{Character Creation}
    [rework in progress]
    First, get a general idea who your character is and what they do. Note your Character name, your name, the name of the
    Campaign and your concept for the character on the Sheet. This will help you choose in the following steps.

    \subhline{Step 1 - Categories}

    Choose Category:\\\\
    If you have grown up without being in contact with Taint you are probably a Dome dwelling Category A Supervivo. \\
    \begin{tabular}{c|l}
        & low hp (3)\\
        & barely any contamination resistance\\
        Category A     & no tech restrictions\\
        & social/educated skills more likely\\
        & DNI possible\\\hline
        & medium hp (6)\\
        & slightly contamination resistant\\
        Category B    & experimental and high tech tend to degrade fast\\
        & practical/combat skills more likely\\
        & able to pilot and survive outside\\\hline
        & high HP (10) \\
        & highly contamination resistant \\
        Category C & anything above basetech, degrades fast\\
        & survival/physical skills more likely\\
        & controlling contamination possible
    \end{tabular}\newline


    \par

    Note your Category and Lifepoint maximum on your Sheet. You may choose your starting Taint from 0-5 at no cost and note
    it aswell. (although you will start dying if it is too much, read up on Charactertaint in the chapter Taint)\\

    \subhline{Step 2 - Abilities}
    Prioritize Social, Physical, Mental, Experience and Training in the order that you think they are most
    usefull to your character concept in. \newline
    In your primary priority you get 25 points, in your secondary priority you get 20 points and in your tertiary
    priority you get 15 points. The remaining Two Priorities get 10 points.\newline
    Within Social, Physical and Mental you can spend your new rating in points to raise an ability by 1, You start with 1
    in Everything. Raising Fitness From one to 4 would cost 2+3+4 = 9 points.\newline
    With Experience You can Pick a Profession, for example Engineer, Medic, Scientist, or a Knowledge for Example
    Geology, Local History Italy, Quantum Mechanics, High Tech Shields, and Note them on Your Character Sheet. They start at
    0. Professions cost the same as Abilities, Knowledges Cost one point per Level. (Knowledges need to be narrow enough,
    Knowledge about Technology needs to be specified to Category of Technology and Techlevel. Related Knowledges might give
    a lesser advantage.)
    With Training you can apply your point to the Skilltrees above.
    Unspent Points remain. Every point requires some sort of mention in the Backstory of the Character, more than 3 points
    in something require a good reason which intertwines with the story of the Character.

    Later Points are awarded to the categories depending on roleplay and successfull missions or can be bought from
    trainers. All such points need to have an ingame reason. Knowledges can only be learned through teachers, sources or
    years of study, a new Training either needs a Teacher or a long time\\
