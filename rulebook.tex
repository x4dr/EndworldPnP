    \section{The EndWorld}\label{sec:theEndworld}

    Years have gone by since the Great War.
    Many Years.
    Even though few remember how long it has been, the remnants of a time long gone still remind us that once,
    long ago, the world has been a nicer place.
    But, the world we know now \ldots is not a nice place.
    Such a shame.
    I have lived a long life, and I have learned to adapt to the new World,
    but just as the Contamination eats away at technology and the lives of those who come into contact with it, time
    eats away at me.
    Such a shame, there is so little of it left for me.
    But the plans are in motion, Immortality might be in my grasp.\par
    I am \ldots well, it seems some Details are starting to slip my mind.
    I am Quaesitor, and yet again I am wrong, but not entirely.
    I was Quaesitor.
    I traveled from the great city of Terracina to the quaint outpost of Kodal to learn.
    A life time of learning of trying to protect what the Supervivo have protected so long.
    The ancient Knowledge and ancient Arts.
    Microelectronics.
    Quantum Physics.
    The like.
    We, the Survivors, the Triumphant, the Conquerors,
    forced to huddle in what were mere shelters for what would be a storm that has not blown over in centuries,
    it is such a shame.
    Marvels of modern technology have kept me from dying these past years since i retired,
    but no army of hightech mechs, no experimental biotech treatment seems to be able to extend my mind.
    I have forgotten so much.
    \par Such a shame.\par
    Of course we are not the only ones who survived.
    Beasts stalk the lands, ferocious beasts, Megafauna, sly, intelligent and hungry creatures.
    In some cases literally.
    But even Humanoids, a pale imitation of real Humans, the descendants of vile mutants,
    military personnel enhancement projects, the failed attempts of foolish hope,
    are vile mutants and savages themselves, such a shame to human kind.
    They raid caravans, keep to their barbaric cultures,
    forever cursed to harbor the very Contamination killing their chances of ever knowing the pleasures of technology.
    And it seems that they have adapted to the Contamination, so it does not even kill
    them as much these days.
    Such a shame. \par
    Alacast can purify them just like anyone or anything else,
    it changes the Contamination back to more normal dangers, but dangers that can be dealt with by real humans.
    Tribals can live without the Contamination,
    if ever someone would invest in cleaning a Savage up that much, they still can not contribute.
    Such a shame.
    I have tried, yet they remained uncooperative, another sign of their inferiority.
    Some babble about cages and insults, barely comprehensible ramblings in their animalistic mockery of
    speech.
    They do not usually last long once they have gone through decon.
    Such a shame.
    Especially those infuriating individuals who seem to have allied with the Contamination trying to kill us all,
    wielding its Zones Of Normalcy Exclusion like weapons.
    Such a shame.
    Wide ZONEs of heightened gravity or brittleness, Oxygen free ZONEs or pure Oxidation.
    Such a shame that they have to appear at all even if caused by natural sources.
    Savages funneling Contamination into a ZONE  until even the best seal breaks down and the Pilots are eaten alive
    \ldots \par Such a Shame. \par \vspace{1cm}

    \section{Character Creation}
    [rework mostly done]\label{sec:characterCreation}
    First, get a general idea who your character is and what they do.
    Note your Character name, your name, the name of the
    Campaign and your concept for the character on the Sheet.
    This will help you choose in the following steps.

    \subsection{Step 1 - Categories}\label{subsec:step1-Categories}

    Choose Category:\\\\
    If you have grown up without being in contact with Contamination you are probably a Dome dwelling Category A Supervivo. \\
    \begin{tabular}{c|l}
        & low hp (4)\\
        & barely any contamination resistance\\
        Category A     & no tech restrictions\\
        & social/educated skills more likely\\
        & DNI possible\\\hline
        & medium hp (5)\\
        & slightly contamination resistant\\
        Category B    & experimental and high tech tend to degrade fast\\
        & practical/combat skills more likely\\
        & able to pilot and survive outside\\\hline
        & high HP (6) \\
        & highly contamination resistant \\
        Category C & anything above basetech, degrades fast\\
        & survival/physical skills more likely\\
        & controlling contamination possible
    \end{tabular}\newline




    Note your Category and Lifepoint maximum on your Sheet.
    You may choose your starting Contamination from 0--5 at no cost and note
    it as well. (although you will start dying if it is too much, read up on Charactercontamination in the chapter Contamination)\\

    \subsection{Step 2 - Abilities}\label{subsec:step2-Abilities}
    Prioritize Social, Physical, Mental, Experience and Training in the order that you think they are most
    usefull to your character concept in. \newline
    In your primary priority you get 25 points, in your secondary priority you get 20 points and in your tertiary
    priority you get 15 points.
    The remaining Two Priorities get 10 points.\newline
    Within Social, Physical and Mental you can spend your new rating in points to raise an ability by 1, You start with 1
    in Everything.
    Raising Fitness From one to 4 would cost 2+3+4 = 9 points.\newline
    With Experience You can Pick a Profession, for example Engineer, Medic, Scientist, or a Knowledge for Example
    Geology, Local History Italy, Quantum Mechanics, High Tech Shields, and Note them on Your Character Sheet.
    They start at
    0.
    Professions are Abilities, Knowledges are Skills and cost one point per Level. (Knowledges need to be narrow enough,
    Knowledge about Technology needs to be specified to Category of Technology and Techlevel.
    Related Knowledges might give
    a lesser advantage.)\\

    In the Training Category you can apply your points to the Tech Abilities or the skills from the Skilltree.
    Every Skill is capped at the level of the node above it.
    If a Characters Weapon Level is 3, the Characters Projectile
    Level can not exceed 3.
    The Skill Direct(Projectile Weapons) itself, in turn can not exceed the Projectile Level.\\


    Unspent Points remain.
    Every point requires some sort of mention in the Backstory of the Character, more than 3 points
    in something require a good reason which intertwines with the story of the Character.

    Later Points are awarded to the categories depending on roleplay and successfull missions or can be bought from
    trainers.
    All such points need to have an ingame reason.
    Knowledges can only be learned through teachers, sources or
    years of study, a new Training either needs a Teacher or a long time\\


    \subsection{Step 3 - Finishing touches}\label{subsec:step3-FinishingTouches}
    You get 80 Credits, you can spend these on:
    Your Mech (see below)\\
    Goods 1:4 (see table in chapter Trade)\\
    XP (1 XP for 10 credits)\\
