    \chapter{The EndWorld}\label{ch:theendworld}

    Years have gone by since the Great War.
    Many Years.
    Even though few remember how long it has been, the remnants of a time long gone still remind us that once,
    long ago, the world has been a nicer place.
    But, the world we know now \ldots is not a nice place.
    Such a shame.
    I have lived a long life, and I have learned to adapt to the new World,
    but just as the Contamination eats away at technology and the lives of those who come into contact with it, time
    eats away at me.
    Such a shame, there is so little of it left for me.
    But the plans are in motion, immortality might be in my grasp.\par
    I am \ldots well, it seems some Details are starting to slip my mind.
    I am Quaesitor, and yet again I am wrong, but not entirely.
    I was Quaesitor.
    I traveled from the great city of Terracina to the quaint outpost of Kodal to learn.
    A life time of learning of trying to protect what the Supervivo have protected so long.
    The ancient Knowledge and ancient Arts.
    Microelectronics.
    Quantum Physics.
    The like.
    We, the Survivors, the Triumphant, the Conquerors,
    forced to huddle in what were mere shelters for a storm that has not subsided over the centuries,
    it is such a shame.
    Marvels of modern technology have kept me from dying these past years since i retired,
    but no army of hightech mechs, no experimental biotech treatment seems to be able to extend my mind.
    I have forgotten so much.
    \par Such a shame.\par
    Of course we are not the only ones who survived.
    Beasts stalk the lands, ferocious beasts, Megafauna, sly, intelligent and hungry creatures.
    In some cases literally.
    But even Humanoids, a pale imitation of real Humans, the descendants of vile mutants,
    military personnel enhancement projects, the failed attempts of foolish hope,
    are vile mutants and savages themselves, such a shame.
    They raid caravans, keep to their disjointed barbaric cultures,
    forever cursed to harbor the very Contamination killing their chances of ever knowing the pleasures of technology.
    And it seems that they have adapted to the Contamination, so it does not even kill them as much these days.
    Such a shame. \par
    Alacast can purify them just like anyone or anything else,
    it changes the Contamination back to more normal dangers, but dangers that can be dealt with by proper humans.
    Tribals can live without the Contamination,
    if ever someone would invest in cleaning a Savage up that much, they likely still can not contribute.
    Such a shame.
    I have tried, yet they remained uncooperative, another sign of their inferiority.
    Some babble about cages and insults, barely comprehensible ramblings in their animalistic mockery of
    speech.
    They do not usually last long once they have gone through decon.
    Such a shame.
    Especially those infuriating individuals who seem to have allied with the Contamination trying to kill us all,
    wielding its Zones Of Normalcy Exclusion like weapons.
    Such a shame.
    Wide ZONEs of heightened gravity or brittleness, Oxygen free ZONEs or pure Oxidation.
    Such a shame that they have to appear at all even if caused by natural sources.
    Savages funneling Contamination into a ZONE  until even the best seal breaks down and the Pilots are eaten alive
    \ldots \par Such a Shame. \par \par

    \section{Rules}\label{sec:rules}
    \input{rules}


    \chapter{Character Creation}\label{ch:charactercreation}
    First, get a general idea who your character is and what they do.
    Note your Character name, your name, the name of the
    Campaign and your concept for the character on the charactersheet.
    This will help you choose in the following steps.

    \section{Step 1 - Categories}\label{sec:step1-categories}

    Choose Category, Fate and Affinity\par
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Resistance} describes how able the Character is to survive the hardships of the outside world
        \item \textbf{Fate} is ``Beginners Luck'' and the room to grow of the character, separating NPC from PC.
        \item \textbf{Affinity} for technology allows usage of complex and futuristic gadgets
    \end{enumerate}
    all start at 1, 7 points are divided between them.
    Fate

    \section{Step 2 - Abilities}\label{sec:step2-abilities}
    Order Social, Physical, Mental, Spiritual and Ability in the order that you think they are most
    usefull to your character concept. \newline
    In your primary priority you get 250 points, in your secondary priority you get 200 points and in your tertiary
    priority you get 150 points.
    The remaining Two Priorities get 100 points.\newline
    Skills Levels, which range from 1--3, have sublevels that also range from 1--5.
    Every point can buy a sublevel, so to raise a skill from level 0 to 2 would take 5+5 = 10 points.
    Attributes, which range from 1--5 can be unlocked by allocating spent skill sublevels.
    Every Attribute Level requires 10 points per level, so the levels have requirments of 10+20+30+40+50 = 150 Sublevels
    for an Attribute on Level 5, which translates to 30 total levels in Skills (which could be 15 skills at level 2)
    To Reach Attributes of 5/5/5 90 total levels of skills (or 450 points) would be required.
    Attributes can be 0, making the character unable to attempt rolls that would use that attribute.



    Specific skills can be at levels 0--3.
    Usually a Level of 1 denotes Proficiency and 2 denotes Mastery,
    3 is mostly only achieved through special circumstances.


    All points need to be spent, although reskilling/attributing a new character can be done if player and Storyteller
    agree.
    Every level 1 skill requires some sort of mention in the backstory of the character, level 2 skills should be given
    an explicit reason and level 3 skills should have an explanation of how the character has reached peak human ability
    in that skill.

    Later Points are awarded to specific Skills through roleplay and spending Off-time training.
    These Skillpoints can then be allocated to an Attribute at any time.

    \section{Step 3 - Finishing touches}\label{sec:step3-finishingtouches}
    You get 100 Credits, you can spend these on:
    \begin{enumerate}[label = -]
        \item Your \hyperref[ch:mechs]{Mech}
        \item \hyperref[ch:tradegoods]{Goods} (3 per credit)
        \item Gear, Spells, etc
        \item \hyperref[sec:step2-abilities]{Bonus Character creation points} (1:1)
    \end{enumerate}
