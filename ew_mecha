ROUGH DRAFT BASICALLY ON THE LEVEL OF MINDSTORMING

definitions:
distance 1 ~= 100 m

stats

emissions 
chemical coordinates and circle X around them for Y time, gradient and time determinable, non parallel
Sound, travels 3 in 1 second, direction not determinable in certain environments

EM: "instant" but need sensor needs to be of same frequency band. LOS applies for most, IR might stay around for a while, like chemical and UV might leave permanent burns. 

IR  decreases 1 every 2 distance, less dampened,
Visible decreases 1 every 1 distance
UV  decreases 1 every 1 distance triggers visible light in some objects
gammaradiation decreases 1 every 5 distance, not dampened by anything other than whole buildings or mountains, less sharp



sensors:

direction threshhold (for each direction information
position threshhold

example:

cheap sensorpackage, size 1
sound: 5, 100
visible: 20, 50


ultra microphones, size 2
sound 1, 5

ultra camera, size 2
IR 	5, 10
visible 1, 5
UV	1, 1

geiger, size 1
gamma  10, 50

sniffer, size 1
chemical 20, 90


energy/heat: 

nuclear reactor, size X, Y: 
output heat and gammaradiation per energy per second, can only be increased/decreased by 1+Y per 10 seconds. up to X

capacitor, size X + (Y + Z)/2: 

saves up to 100*X energy, chargemax: 5*Y, dischargemax: 5*Z


coolant system, size X + Y :

internal buffer of  100*X heat, can transfer 10*Y heat per second

radiator, size X:

internal buffer of 10*X heat, radiates half of own heat as IR every second

coolant dump port, size 5

internal buffer of 100 heat, can over 1 second  set self to 0, leaves 100 heat, dissipating by 1 every second and chemical 100, dissipating 1 every minute on current position, consumes 1 coolant charge from cargo.


movement and tracking: 
operative movement is in meters, tactical in 100 meters and strategical in 10 km

tracking:
tracking is given as distance below tracking 10 m/s is not possible any more

m/s: movement is given in meters per second

movement system, size x+y 
accelleration costs Y*5 size points for the ability to change energy consumption by Y per second.
strength energy per second for movementcap meter per second. 
(1 energy / second => 1* movementcap/strength per second +1 heat/second)
movement cap is (strength * 50 / total mech size) m/s


weapons

guns
consumes ammo from cargo (belt), every shot is X/500 cargo of ammo

Autocannon X + Y + Z:

does X^(1/4) damage

10/Y^(1/2) seconds between shots,
 
Z^(1/4) = accuracy bonus (speed), 

consumes sqrt(Y) energy and 1 ammo (chain) produces ((X+Y)^(1/2)+Z) heat per shot


sniper x+y+z

does x^(1/2) damage

fire rate of Y^(1/4) shots every 10 seconds

adds Z^(1/3) accuracy for every aimed turn. Z = range

consumes X^(1/3)+Z energy


laser x+y+Z

does x^(1/2) damage
takes Y energy per second, takes X energy to recharge.
Z^(1/3) accuracy bonus, z = range




shields size X + Y + Z:

capacitor of size 10 * X
sqrt(sqrt(Y)/100 *capacity) = max hp
chargerate of 1+Z per second
capacity / max hp = energy per hp (lost hp  loose an appropriate amount of energy)

deflectors size X + Y:

use X+Y energy per second
maxlevel Y (charge 1/s)

provides (X*level)^(1/2) points of deflection


armor size X +Y:

x^(1/2) HP
y^(1/3) resistance (subtracts from incoming damage)


hit roll = check hit + accuracybonus + targetsize + sensorbonus - enemy check dodge - deflection -range

0 or less: no hit
1 - 3: graze, armor applies resistance *3
4 - 5: indirect hit, armor applies resistance *2
6 - 8: hit, calculate damage normally
9 -10: check for systemhit 
11-15: check for systemhit, armor applies resistance/2 rounded up
16-20: check for systemhit, armor applies resistance/2 rounded down
21+ : ignore 1 point of target armor, subtract 5 successes

systemhit:
define subsystem to hit. difficulty (1- system size / mecha size)*10 
check crit against difficulty. 
on hit, calculate damage for mecha and system.
on miss, calculate damage normally



new proficiencies

combat: hit dodge crit
pilot: defense management computer



example mech:
reactor: 100, 20 = 120
capacitor: 10, 10, 10 = 20
cooling: 10, 10 = 20
radiator : 20 = 20
shield : 120 (6 HP, 24 second full reload, 4 s => 1 hp; at 24 energy/s)
	cap =57 
	efficiency = 49 
	speed = 23

autocannon:120
	calibre= 16
	speed = 100
   	accuracy = 4
	
cargo:10
movement: 120
	accel: 20 ==> 4
	strength: 100
	movement cap = Strength*50:5000/mechsize:550 = 9 m/s


sizeclass 6


exampleattack:

with autocannon 16 100 4

2 damage, 1 shot per second 
2 base accuracy 

consumes 10 energy and 1/32 ammo cargo  per shot
produces 15 heat per shot


accuracybonus 	= 2
target size   	= 6
enemydodge 	= -1d10
deflection 	= -0
sensorbonus 	= 0
range		= 500m = -5
		=+3-1d10

28%: no hit
27%: graze, armor applies resistance *3
17%: indirect hit, armor applies resistance *2
18%: hit, calculate damage normally
7%: check for systemhit 
3%: check for systemhit, armor applies resistance/2 rounded up


every second there is a 72% chance to deal 2 damage to shields. every 4 seconds shields regen by 1

dps = 0.72*2 = 1.44 
hps = 0.25*1 = 0.25

effective dps = 1.19 against shields.

---TAINTWORKS\\

To be able to work Taint is to be able to controll the Nanoswarms that make up part of the Taint. A character wishing to
employ a certain technique first has to let the Taint flood through them and make a connection. The Charactertaint living
in their body has to be used to imprint their will onto the Taint around them. To do so puts the body in great peril.\\

Immediately do a Taintcheck (see chapter Taint in Health and Taint). Then, Check Resonance +Charactertaint. If the
result is higher than the complexity of the technique, it succeeds with a degree of success
depending the amount by which the roll exceeded the complexity. If the result was not higher than the complexity,
the difference is dealt to the character as damage(not Taint damage).\\
Effects marked as passive have specific start and end conditions. \\
Effects marked as sustained stay for as long as the character focusses on them. Each sustained effect is applied as a -1
modifier to all subsequent rolls. Once a day a Willpower Check can be made, the result of which reduces the modifiers from sustained effects.\\


List of Taintworks(incomplete):\\
\begin{enumerate}[label= - ]
\item Achieve Symbiosis: Complexity 18, required ambient Taint: 8\\
Passive. Begins after meditating for at least an hour. As long as at least 1 Charactertaint remains inside the Character,
they dont roll the daily Taintcheck anymore.\\

\item Concentrate: Complexity 11, required ambient Taint: 1\\
Sustained. After concentrating on a place in line of sight for one round, raise ambient Taint at target by [degree of success].
Covers about a cubic meter.

\item Infuse: complexity 12, does not require ambient Taint\\
Restores [degree of success] LP to touched target. Raises Charactertaint of target characters by 1.
Inflicts [degree of success]+1 Taint damage over 10 days to target constructs.

\item Expunge: complexity 15, does not require ambient Taint\\
Expunges up to [degree of success] Charactertaint, dealing twice the expunged amount as Taint damage.

\item Gravitation: complexity 15, required ambient Taint: 6\\
Sustained. After conentrating on a place in line of sight for three rounds, the local gravity at that place raises by
[degree of success]G. covers about ten times ambient Taint above 5 square meters.
